# Prototype Editor

Aka why you don't ask programmers to pick a good project name.

## About

Prototype Editor is an online code editor with code compilation and execution. Currently C, C++, Java, and Python are supported. 

Create repositories, or collections of files, and edit them on your own or share with other contributors. Live collaborative editing allows you to see what your collaborators are working on.
